# Phase-4 Project - Granular Planner

## User Stories

Granular Planner provides users a way to organize their daily schedules in a granular way.
    Users can 
        - View kinds of Days (e.g. Weekend, Weekday etc.), the Routines within them and the Tasks that make up those Routines
        - Edit, add and remove Days, Routines and Tasks

## React Components and Routing

`README.md` is a Markdown file that describes your project. These files can be
used in many different ways- you may have noticed that we use them to generate
entire Canvas lessons- but they're most commonly used as homepages for online
Git repositories. **When you develop something that you want other people to
use, you need to have a README.**

Markdown is not a language that we cover in Flatiron's Software Engineering
curriculum, but it's not a particularly difficult language to learn (if you've
ever left a comment on Reddit, you might already know the basics). Refer to the
cheat sheet in this lesson's resources for a basic guide to Markdown.

## Backend



This README should serve as a template for your own- go through the important
files in your project and describe what they do. Each file that you edit (you
can ignore your migration files) should get at least a paragraph. Each function
should get a small blurb.

You should descibe your application first, and with a good level of detail. The
rest should be ordered by importance to the user. (Probably routes next, then
models.)

Screenshots and links to resources that you used throughout are also useful to
users and collaborators, but a little more syntactically complicated. Only add
these in if you're feeling comfortable with Markdown.

## Conclusion

A lot of work goes into a full-stack application, but it all relies on concepts
that you've practiced thoroughly throughout this phase. Hopefully this template
and guide will get you off to a good start with your Phase 4 Project.

Happy coding!
